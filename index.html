          <h3>Melodii Music Player</h3>
          <p>Melodii is an Electron Based Music Player. While not a commercial product, Melodii is a large scale project meant to help me develop my skills as an app developer and gain experience with numerous Computery concepts like how music files are organized, compression, the Web Audio API and more.</p>

          <h3>Save Sync</h3>
          <p>I like cloud saves for games. However many games I play don't have the luxury of Steam or Origin Cloud Saving. Without a service, playing a game on my Desktop, and then continuing where I left off on my laptop is a tedious task since I have to send files from my Desktop to my Laptop. Save Sync automates the process by smartly managing data.</p>
